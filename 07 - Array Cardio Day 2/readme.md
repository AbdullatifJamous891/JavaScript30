## Lessons Learned

### `array.some()`
Loop through the items in an array until you meet one that matches the conditions contained in the function inside `some()`. This returns `true` or `false`, depending on whether there were any.

### `array.every()`
Same thing as some, except it only returns `true` if every single element in the array meets the conditions.

### `array.find()`
Returns the object inside the array that meets the conditions.

### `array.findIndex()`
Returns the index of the object inside the array that meets the conditions.

### Extras
`array.splice(num, 1)` will remove 1 element from the array, starting at the `num` index.

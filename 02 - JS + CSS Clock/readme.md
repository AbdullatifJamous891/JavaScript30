## Lessons Learned
I actually did this one by myself after he gave me the CSS properties to adjust and Javascript methods to get time. Yay, me.

###CSS
`transform: rotate(90deg)` rotates an object. Other cool shit to do with transform?

`transform-origin` changes the inflection point upon which an object rotates

`transition: all .5s` animates changes to CSS properties

`transition-timing-function` makes for various transitions

### Javascript
`setInterval(functionName, 1000)` runs a function every X number of milliseconds (here is the code to run the function every 1s)

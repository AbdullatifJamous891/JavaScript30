## Lessons Learned

The more of these I do, the less I have to write. I think that's a good thing.

Remember: `getBoundingClientRect()` grabs top, left, width, height of the thing that triggered the event.

`setTimeout(() => {}, 150)` -> runs something (between the curly brackets) after 150 ms have passed.

If you are running this, you need to make sure to offset the background div by whatever is above / to the left of it.

## Lessons Learned

I didn't find this lesson all that useful, except if I want to build something with drag-and-drop. It would be an interesting challenge to take this nugget and make something like that. Maybe one day...

`transform: scale(0.98)` animated to `transform: scale(1)` makes for a lovely "focus" effect

`console.log({var})` returns `Obj { var: 'value' }`. Super useful.
